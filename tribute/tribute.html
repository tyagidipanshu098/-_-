          <span class="s">S</span>rinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar was an Indian
          mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of
          mathematics, particularly in the area of number theory. Born in 1887
          in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, Ramanujan's mathematical talents were
          recognized early on, but he faced significant obstacles in pursuing
          his studies due to his lack of formal education and financial
          difficulties. Despite these challenges, Ramanujan developed a vast and
          complex system of mathematical theories and formulas, many of which
          were well ahead of their time. He is perhaps best known for his work
          on partition functions and the Ramanujan prime, and his insights have
          had a profound impact on modern mathematics. Ramanujan passed away in
          1920 at the young age of 32, but his legacy continues to inspire
          mathematicians around the world to this day.
